ASTrio In-house-built Desktop Engine (AIDE) is a desktop GUI project based on AIBE (https://github.com/ian5666987/AIBE.git) and is created solely by me (though it contains a company name: ASTrio).

*) Please change the "DHObscured" class name to "DH" to be able to compile the project.
*) See my AIBE project repository for more information.
