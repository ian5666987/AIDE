ASTrio In-house-built Desktop Engine (AIDE) is a desktop GUI project created by me based on previously created AIBE (https://github.com/ian5666987/AIBE). See my AIBE project repository for more information.

To use it:

*) Please change the "DHObscured" class name to "DH" to be able to compile the project.
*) See my AIBE project repository for more information.
